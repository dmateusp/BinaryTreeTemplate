# BinaryTreeTemplate
Creating my own Binary Tree to understand how the Data structure works

## VideoGame class
This class is only used to show that the Tree can work with custom types
BUT : the operators <, >, == need to be overloaded first

### To students : do not use that code to cheat during a CA please :)
Use it to understand !

I did not use any online resource so do not take this as the "best and only" solution.
